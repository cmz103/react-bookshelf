# Bookshelf Udacity Class Project

Bookshelf is an application written in React and React Router. You can search for a book and add them to either the "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read" shelf. Additionally, you can move books into other shelves.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/cmz103/react-bookshelf.git
```
2. Install all project dependencies
```
yarn install
// or
npm install
```
3. Start the development server
```
yarn start
// or
npm start
```
4. You should now be able to go to your browser at `http://localhost:3000/` and view the app. Note that changes are automatically recompiled and the browser is refreshed.
